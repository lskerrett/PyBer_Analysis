# PyBer_Analysis


## Purpose of the assignement

We were asked by the CEO to create a summary DataFrame of the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type. We received data from the company and use Panda, Numpy and Matplolib to analyse the data and create a final line chart that is easy to read for the CEO. 

The graphs show that there is less drivers in the rural area and although there is more rides in the city the ones in the rural commumity are more expensive.
