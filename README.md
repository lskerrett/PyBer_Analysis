# PyBer_Analysis


## Purpose of the assignement

We were asked by the CEO to create a summary DataFrame of the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type. We received data from the company and use Panda, Numpy and Matplolib to analyse the data and create a final line chart that is easy to read for the CEO. 

The graphs show:

Even if the fares are higher in the rural areas, that most of the revenue (assuming that the company gets a share of the fares received by the drivers) comes from the urban areas

This can be explain by the fact that there is less drivers in rural areas.

That in the first quater of the year, the urban, suburban and rural had the same fluctuations.

## Challenges

The challenge was to group and compare different files. For this we used the merge function in panda. 
The other challenges was to determine which type of graph will be the most useful for the CEO and how to interpretated them. We usematplotlib and matplotlib to create the graph. 

## Next

We can recommend that the company increase the number of drivers in the rural areas. 
We should also do an anylisis for the cost for the drivers (suburban and rural areas can use more gas for exemple). 
We should also do an anlysis of the demographics that is using the service in each type of city.
